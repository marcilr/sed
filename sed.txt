sed (stream editor) is a Unix utility that parses and transforms text,
using a simple, compact programming language. sed was developed from
1973 to 1974 by Lee E. McMahon of Bell Labs,[1] and is available today
for most operating systems.[2] sed was based on the scripting features
of the interactive editor ed ("editor", 1971) and the earlier qed
("quick editor", 1965-66). sed was one of the earliest tools to support
regular expressions, and remains in use for text processing, most notably
with the substitution command. Popular alternative tools for plaintext
string manipulation and "stream editing" include AWK and Perl.
